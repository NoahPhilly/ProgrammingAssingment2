## Programming Assignment 2 Description

This program is very self-explanatory. You will open the GuiRunner class and execute the program.<BR>
From here you must be sure to ENTER FULLSCREEN within the application, as for whatever reason <br>
the scroll bar will not render properly. From here, you need to enter at least one type of choice for <br>
any choice box that has (select one) next to it or else the program will flunk out. You will be able <br> 
to return back to the initial VBox once you select the Choice Boxes correctly. The formatting for<br>
when you input multiple burgers and pizza is very messy, but it does work. Thank you!
